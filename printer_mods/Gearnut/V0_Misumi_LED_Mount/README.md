V0 Misumi Led mount

These were modified from the Misumi Led mounts as I like the design with them in my V2.4 The angle was made a bit more shallow to shine more light on the bed and extruder and to pull the leds back from the extruder assembly I made them slightly longer though they can be sliced a bit short if your led strip has more LEDs per inch than mine did. Should fit most WS2812b Led strips you can find online though If it has the silicone cover on them you may need to peel them off or file down the inside track a touch.

You will need 5 per side and standard voron print settings are probably overkill for these but its what I used. For install on a stock V0 simply remove the rail and slide inside. Fitment for me was very tight and the rails did shave a little bit off the mounting points. This was intentional to make it as tight as possible.
